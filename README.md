# EfficientGS
Efficient Toolkits for 3D Gaussian Splatting
+ [GSplat](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/gsplat)
  gsplat is an open-source library for CUDA accelerated rasterization of gaussians with python bindings. It is inspired by the SIGGRAPH paper 3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time   Rendering of Radiance Fields, but weâ€™ve made gsplat even faster, more memory efficient, and with a growing list of new features!
+ [FlashGS](https://github.com/InternLandMark/FlashGS)
  FlashGS is an efficient CUDA Python library, enabling real-time 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based rendering especially for large-scale and high-resolution scenes.
